Starting with the symbolic expression y = (x-1)^100, we try to obtain a vector of its coefficients 
using sym2poly. I also did this with coeffs, which unfortunately crashed Matlab when I tried to 
do anything with it. Looking at the vector of coefficients produced by sym2poly we see that there are
zeros and very small numbers. I suspect that in dealing with such large integers that have to be
converted to a vector of floats, we have had overflow and large rounding errors in the conversion
process. We note that in the expansion of our function the coefficients of highest magnitude will be
100C49 which is of the 29th order of magnitude ~ 1e+29. This is relatively close to the largest
possible float with a precision of up to 38 decimals.
