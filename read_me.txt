This repository contains all the homework for St.Petersburg State University's Faculty of Applied Math and Control Processes' Matlab course for the spring semester of 
freshman year for the academic year 2020-2021. I do not guarantee that any program uploaded to this repository meets the grading criterion of the assessing party for this
particular course. Caveat emptor :)
