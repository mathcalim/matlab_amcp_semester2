3. Изучить функцию fminsearch. Чем она отличается от fminbnd?

(I hope it's ok that I answer these in English)
fminbnd attempts to find the minimum of a function within some bounded
and closed subset of R, in our case that is simply an array with a minimum
and maximum value, which is where we get the abbreviation 'bnd'. fminsearch
is an iterative algorithm that finds a minimum value, starting with some 
approximation that the user gives. It accepts only one argument, instead of two.

4. Как работает функция islocalmin?

I'm not exactly sure how the algorithm works, but the use of islocalmin 
is as such. We pass some array A of values to the function, along with the
function that we are investigating. islocalmin returns an array with the
exact same length as the array passed consisting of 1's and 0's, where
1 is at an index i if the function has a local minimum at A(i,1), and 0
otherwise.

5. Какую дополнительную информацию можно получить с помощью функции optimset?

Used together with fminsearch, for example, optimset allows us to set stricter
stopping conditions, meaning that we may manually set a much higher error
tolerance in order to find our extrema to a higher degree of precision.
